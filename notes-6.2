Motor Position

Power increases but velocity decreases while being held.

++ PID is used if setting the position, but not power.

Motor Power

The power stays constant but the degrees per second / rotational velocity varies with the load placed upon the motor. A greater load results in reduced velocity.


Motor Damage Per Strike

Power increases but velocity(dps) stays the same while being held.
