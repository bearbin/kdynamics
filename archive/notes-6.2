**Motor DPS (Degrees Per Second)**

PID is followed.
When a hand is applied, the power increases, putting more force on your hand.
Velocity(dps) drops, but the acceleration increases to meet the demand.


**Motor Position**

For position, PID protocol is also followed.

Note that when the target is very close to the current position,
insufficient power means that the error of 1-2 degrees can persist for some time.
In order to fix this, the PID integral factor may be increased.

Even rotating manually as fast as possible, no more than around 20% of power is
required to match this quickly.

If the hand grip is too tight to allow the wheel to rotate, the motor will
make up the difference as soon as the hand is released.


**Motor Power**

PID is not followed.
Target power is matched almost instantly and very precisely.

When a hand is applied, the power stays constant but the degrees per second / rotational velocity
varies with the load placed upon the motor. A greater load results in reduced velocity.

Much less resistance is felt by the holding hand, as PID does not build up
against it.
