# 1. Minimum and Maximum Range

When less than 5 cm from the wall, the sensor tends to report 6cm as the measured distance. Above 5 or 6 cm
from the wall the measured value is correct.

In free space, the measured value remains correct up to the maximum range of the sensor (255 cm). However,
when there are obstructions or non-optimal wall textures the reading is less reliable, depending on the level
of occlusion. Below ~100cm the sensor almost always reports a correct value however.

# 2. Angular Deviation

The sensor appeared to record correct values for distance at angular deviations of up to 30* from the
perpendicular.

At deviations exceeding 30* but below 45*, the sensor returned a mixture of correct distance measurements
and what appeared to be random noise and errors, with long periods of 255 values returned.

At deviations of more than 45*, the sensor did not return useful results, and instead gave spurious values.

# 3. Systematic Errors

The sensor did not appear to have any systematic error over the range tested (20-100cm). Although the values
returned were 1cm below the true value, this is well within the uncertainty of the true value arising from
deficiencies in the measurement technique (parallax etc)

## Table of results

 Distance From Wall | Reported Distance
--------------------+-------------------
                 20 | 20
                 40 | 39
                 60 | 59
                 80 | 79
                100 | 99

# 4. Repeatability and Scatter

The resolution of the sensor and the number of readings taken were not sufficient to determine if
the scatter of the sensor is dependent on the distance away from the wall; in any case the level of
scatter is extremely small and not likely to have any effect on the performance of our localisation
system.

 Distance From Wall | Reported Distances
--------------------+----------------------------------------
                 40 | 40, 39, 39, 39, 38, 39, 39, 38, 38, 39
                100 | 98, 99, 99, 99, 98, 98, 97, 99, 99, 98

# 5. Subjective Analysis

In the expected environment (the ~2m modified square box) with the robot making only 90* turns and avoiding obstacles by at least 5cm,
we would expect the sonar sensor to give correct values almost 100% of the time (except when actively turning).

In a more general environment with small occlusions, and non-orthagonal surfaces (or unlocked robot rotation),
we would expect incorrect values to be returned much more frequently - of course the exact value would depend on the
precise nature of the environment in question.

In a very large empty space we would expect the ultrasonic sensor to give incorrect readings 100% of the time in
an absolute sense (the wall is not 255cm away in this environment), however the sensor will still provide useful
information in that the wall is more than 255cm away. If the 255 case were defined as >254cm rather than an absolute
value then it would in fact always give correct readings.

The sensor also fails in dynamic environments with other moving objects not part of the environment against which
localisation should be performed.
