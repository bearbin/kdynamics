# 1. Minimum and Maximum Range

When less than 5 cm from the wall, the sensor tends to report 6cm as the measured distance. Above 5 or 6 cm
from the wall the measured value is correct.

In free space, the measured value remains correct up to the maximum range of the sensor (255 cm). However,
when there are obstructions or non-optimal wall textures the reading is less reliable, depending on the level
of occlusion. Below ~100cm the sensor almost always reports a correct value however.

# 2. Angular Deviation

The sensor appeared to record correct values for distance at angular deviations of up to 30* from the
perpendicular.

At deviations exceeding 30* but below 45*, the sensor returned a mixture of correct distance measurements
and what appeared to be random noise and errors, with long periods of 255 values returned.

At deviations of more than 45*, the sensor did not return useful results, and instead gave spurious values.

# 3. Systematic Errors

The sensor did not appear to have any systematic error over the range tested (20-100cm). Although the values
returned were 1cm below the true value, this is well within the uncertainty of the true value arising from
deficiencies in the measurement technique (parallax etc)

## Table of results

 Distance From Wall | Reported Distance
--------------------+-------------------
                 20 | 20
                 40 | 39
                 60 | 59
                 80 | 79
                100 | 99

# 4. Repeatability and Scatter

The resolution of the sensor and the number of readings taken were not sufficient to determine if
the scatter of the sensor is dependent on the distance away from the wall; in any case the level of
scatter is extremely small and not likely to have any effect on the performance of our localisation
system.
